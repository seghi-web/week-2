    Oromo, Somali, Sidama and Afar. Speaking Amharinya and Tigrinya does not make these people other than Agaw. Just like the Brazilians are not Portuguese by speaking the language of their colonizer, the Agaw people can not be non-Agaw for not speaking their priori language. If they want to revive their true identity, all the Agaw nationals first need to be politically conscious. I personally think and believe that people in Abyssinia are the Habeshanized parts of Cushitic Afar, Beja, Agaw, Saho and Oromo, who denied their true self. To mention as further examples, the southern part of Tigrai (the Raayya) are Oromo, the eastern part are Afar, the north-eastern part are Saho and the rest are Agaw. Regarding Eritrea, the western part are mostly the Habeshanized Beja, the center as well as the southern part are the Habeshanized Agaw and the eastern part are the Habeshanized as well as the non-Habeshanized Saho and Afar.

    Here, I must stress that, not only Habeshanized Agaw, but also Habeshanized Oromo of north Shoa in Amhara region, east Wallo, south Tigrai and south Gojjam, should try to resurrect their true identity. I know that most of them did not lose their Cushitic culture, but surely they had already lost their Afaan Oromo. Now, it is the right time for them to try to find their priori identity, and say ‘no’ to the ongoing entertainment of their false self. I am sure, if they count back seven generation of their ancestors, they all can find who they really are, instead of just looking at the language they do now speak and identify themselves as Amhara or Tegaru. Also, this lost part of Oromo community need necessary help of the politically conscious Oromo nationalists

        <h3>What we Do</h3>
        <p>
            The question now to be asked should be: is such renaissance of the Agaw identity possible? The answer is in short, ‘yes,’ but to be successful, this traumatized nation is now in a desperate need of help from its brotherly Cushitic nations, like the Oromo, Somali, Sidama and Afar. Speaking Amharinya and Tigrinya does not make these people other than Agaw. Just like the Brazilians are not Portuguese by speaking the language of their colonizer, the Agaw people can not be non-Agaw for not speaking their priori language. If they want to revive their true identity, all the Agaw nationals first need to be politically conscious. I personally think and believe that people in Abyssinia are the Habeshanized parts of Cushitic Afar, Beja, Agaw, Saho and Oromo, who denied their true self.
