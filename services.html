        <h3>Web Desing</h3>
        <p>The question now to be asked should be: is such renaissance of the Agaw identity possible? The answer is in short, ‘yes,’ but to be successful, this traumatized nation is now in a desperate need of help from its brotherly Cushitic nations, like the Oromo, Somali, Sidama and Afar. Speaking Amharinya and Tigrinya does not make these people other than Agaw. Just like the Brazilians are not Portuguese by speaking the language of their colonizer, the Agaw people can not be non-Agaw for not speaking their priori language. If they want to revive their true identity, all the Agaw nationals first need to be politically conscious.</p>
    <p> Pricing: $1,000 - $3,000</p>
